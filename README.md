# LendingClub_Classification_Using_Keras_API
LendingClub , a San Francisco-based company in the US is a leading peer-to-peer lending platform. It holds the distiction of being the first peer-to-peer lender to register its securities offerings with SEC and to facilitate loan trading on a secondary market.
We would be using the dataset provided on Kaggle -: https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club
Using Tensorflow 2.0 Keras API, We will try to build a model which classifies  if a borrower has defaulted(charged-off) or not.
This way in the future when we get a new potential customer, we can assess whether or not they are likely to pay back the loan.
